## Langue and Parole

Two different and complementary ways of thinking about language...

Ferdinand de Saussure (1916)

- *Langue*: the principles of (a) language. A system shared by all speakers.
- *Parole*: actual uses of a language (speech acts) by individuals in real situations.

---

## Formal Language Learning

- When we learn languages through formal education we learn **langue**.
- General language rules.
- Always a **gap** between langue and parole.
- Parole is as varied as the individuals that use a langue.

> To invoke the first principle of social constructionism, groups are real if people think they are: they behave in ways that assume that groups are real and, undoing so, construct the reality. They realise it.
